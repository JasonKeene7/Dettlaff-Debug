Issue: Brown Out when rapid-firing darts
10/31/2023 22:35, @kelly: "The MCU browns out sometimes if you run an N20 motor"
10/31/2023 22:37, @kelly: "Brownouts happened with all the different pusher driver circuits"
10/31/2023 22:39, @kellybot: "n20 motor under load" 
"brown out happens after a mag dump"
10/31/2023 22:41, @jelly: "and it is made wors by running the flywheel motors at a higher power"
10/31/2023 22:41, @kelly: "15 darts work but 20 sometimes doesn't"
10/31/2023 23:41, @jelly: "Finger still on trigger burnout"
10/31/2023 23:47, @kelly: "The flywheels could be getting bogged down with high dps firing and then they draw more current" 
"I think the pusher driver obsession is a red herring"
10/31/2023 23:55, @kellybot: "So the wierd thing is sometimes it still browns out on low fps"
10/31/2023 23:55, @jelly: "i cant recall noticing a difference, however elvin has low rpm and chilling"
10/31/2023 23:56, @kellybot: "And for 650 rpm motor test it browned out after two consecutive extended talon mag dumps"
10/31/2023 23:56, @Jason: "But does the count till brown out increase?"
10/31/2023 23:56, @kellybot -> @Jason: "yeah i think so but it's inconsistent"
10/31/2023 23:57, @jelly: "first test with one cap after new firmware was 2 extended talons before brownout"
"later that day browned out after like 5 rounds"
10/31/2023 23:58, @Jason: "OK, so _pusher fps] and [dart count till brown out] are inversey related then?"
10/31/2023 23:37, @kelly -> @Jason: "I think so"
11/1/2023 00:00, @Jason: "Do the barel motors go out too?"
11/1/2023 00:00, @jelly -> @Jason: "yeah when dettlaff browns out, the esc shuts off"
11/1/2023 00:01, @Jason: "2 flywheel, one pusher"
11/1/2023 00:35, @kelly: "I thought higher battery voltage caused more brownouts"
11/1/2023 10:17, @kellybot: Tried different resistors for motor driver
11/1/2023 00:00, @ahaleshadic: "Can you supply the rail from  bench supply and see if it still browns out"
11/1/2023 10:29, @kelly: "Bench supply can't sink current, will kill dettlaff when you spin down the flywheels"
11/1/2023 10:31, @jelly -> kelly: "wait is that true if you just power the esp32? would the battery still take current from the motors"
11/1/2023 10:36, @Jason: "You could power the ESC from a lipo and the dettlaff from a bench supply or a second lipo"
11/1/2023 13:20, @fadetokelly: "Sort of. When the batery hits 15.7ish volts. Detlaff of something reboots. Not sure if its a brownout or what."
11/1/2023 13:44, @jelly: "still browns out with fancy cap across the battery in"
11/1/2023 13:45, @kellybot: "Dettlaff already has decoupling cas for power"

!-FUNCTIONALITY-!
11/1/2023 14:19, @Jason: "What's mode 1?"
11/1/2023 14:20, @Jason: "And how many modes are there?"
11/1/2023 14:20, @jelly -> @Jason: "mode 0 stops firing when trigger is release, mode 1 fires until the set burst length is hit"
11/1/2023 15:53, @Jason: "@fadetokelly also mind holding down the trigger without firing any darts? Just wanna see what happens"
11/1/2023 16:01, @fadetokelly -> @Jason: "you dont need to hold the trigger down unlss set to 0"

!-PARTS LIST-!
> Motor Drivers
10/31/2023 23:37, @shadowelly: "For n20 style pushers"
10/31/2023 23:37, @shadowelly: "Motor Braking"
10/31/2023 23:37, @jelly: "Motor braking and reverse polarity"
10/31/2023 23:37, @jelly: "So it stops precicely to control feeding"
10/31/2023 23:39, @shadowelly: "There is also adjustable current limits, ability to drive noids, a bunch of protection stuff"
>> DRV8243
10/31/2023 22:35, @kelly: "No I switched to DRV8243 for higher current output"
>> AT8870

> Motor
>> N20 Pusher
>> Flywheels

!-THEORIES-!
Too much power being drawn by the three motors. Since the entire Dettlaff BOs, it may be total power draw.
> Test dart fps until burnout
>> Count number of darts till burnout
> Monitor motor temperature, voltage, and current
> Seperate flywheels from pusher motor
>> Mag dump darts with pusher without flywheels
> Replace lipo with power supply:
>> Regular mag dump
>> Sweep voltage above and below BO

Motor driver not providing enough current to N20.
> Simplify motor driver to use only one MOSFET
>> Needs motor breaking and reverse polarity

!-TEST MATERIALS-!
Needed supplies
> Blaster with Dettlaff Circuitry
>> Updated circuit diagram
> Lipo batteries and charger
> FPS meter
> Multiple mags: 15, 20+ capacity
> Simple motor driver
>> Can build MOSFET H-Bridge too

Mercer Lab Equipment
> Oscilloscopes with drawer of probes
>> Thermocouple for 
> DC power supply
> Assortment of capacitors and resistors
>> Other unssorted SMD components

11/1/2023 13:30, @fadetokelly: "15.4 volts measured using my multimeter. 600rpm n20 from OOD pusher. 24 round full koda magazine. 200fps. full auto mag dump."
"At the end of the mag dump, got the beeping sound from when you first plug in the battery and i guess esc's make a beep booop sound."
11/1/2023 13:40, @fadetokelly - VIDEO 1 > Mode 0 on, Mag dumps 23 darts, takes finger off trigger. Re-presses trigger and blaster BOs
@fadetokelly - VIDEO 2 > Conforms with voltmeter that battery is at 15.4V

11/1/2023 13:38, @Gelly77: "What happens if you hold the trigger for a few seconds after you finish the mag dump then release it? Does it have the same behaviour?"
"And is there a way for you to easily run the pusher but not the main flywheel ESCs? Might be worth isolating running just the pusher independently of the flywheels"
11/1/2023 13:44, @fadetokelly -> @Gelly77: "After mag dump, mag empty, and i held down the full auto trigger i manage to get it to brown out"

11/1/2023 13:47, @shadowelly: "So brownout before of after you releas the trigger"
11/1/2023 13:47, @fadetokelly: "After I release the trigger"
"And the motors are spinning down"

11/1/2023 13:50, @fadetokelly - VIDEO 3 > Mode 0 on, Mags dumps 23 darts, browns out after release, no re-press

11/1/2023 13:49, @Jason: "Are the flywheels getting hot?"
11/1/2023 13:53, @fadetokelly -> @Jason: "This is maybe 5 minutes after thr mag dump"

11/1/2023 13:53, @fadetokelly, VIDEO 4 > Shows motor temperature to be 51.1degC
11/1/2023 14:16, @Jason: "And room temp is?"
11/1/2023 14:16, @fadetokelly -> @Jason: "22c - 23c based on my thermocoupler when i turned it on"

11/1/2023 13:55, @jelly: "jumps around but this is how battery voltage settles with trigger pulled"
@jelly - PICTURE 1 > Voltage trace, mean at 14.981V, peak-to-peak 191,730mV

11/1/2023 14:11, @jelly: "20 round burst with buffer mode 1 works no brownouts"
11/1/2023 14:19, @jelly: "ok 25 round burst, buffer mode 1, gets through 2 talons fine"

11/1/2023 16:00, @fadetokelly - VIDEO 5 > Mode 1 on, no darts, no BOs in 3 tests
